(McConnell)

I'm feeling like I used to belong
Running around this place
My theory was 'head home before dawn'
Or end up without a space
My future was some merry-go-round
On horses that learned to fly

Home, rest assured
And a life, unobscured

I'd toss away some days at a time

With chapters upon the floor
I tell myself I'm part of a tribe
And that I've been here before -

Home, rest assured
And a life, unobscured
Hide by the shore
While outside of the door
