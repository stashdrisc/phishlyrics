The Line
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell)


Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero’s what I’m not
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifixion shot

Friends were electric on the western side while triangles were shifting on the floor
Squeezing out the breath that I don’t have, they’re quiet now, they only want to more

And you step to the line
And you step to the line

Every shot I’ve taken has led me to this moment since I was four feet high
Big D is watching, I remember what he taught me, don’t let him see you cry

And you step to the line
And you step to the line

Try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
Try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time

Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero’s what I’m not
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifiction shot

And you step to the line
And you step to the line

You try to see your future from the line
Clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
You’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
Clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller . . .
