You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)

It's kinda like the theme from the "Fish" TV show
You know - with Abe Vigoda

Little red wagon took a big jump
(Cuddly but deadly)
That pup was caught in a centrifuge
(Herbivorous, crepuscular)

Never did tumble over the side of the hill
(Discovered by a man named Wilson)
Kept flying down to Baton Rouge

Spit out the seeds
Gnaw on the pulp
Suck on the juice
And simmer the rinds
(Herbivorous, crepuscular)

Look at everything
You had to have
Bring it forward
(Bring it forward or leave it behind)
Or leave it behind

Cuddly, but muscular

Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular
