Talk
(Anastasio/Marshall)

I can't talk my talk with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught

I can't talk my talk with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught
I can't talk my talk with you

I can't sing my song with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught

I can't sing my song with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught
I can't sing my song with you

I can't talk my talk with you
