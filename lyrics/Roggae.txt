Roggae
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell/Marshall)

The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise
I love the shiny music that descends from overhead
Gordon knew the moment when the stars all turned around
But from that vantage point I frowned

If life were easy and not so fast
I wouldn't think about the past.
I can't forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share 
of darkness and of light

So now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist
provoking dreams that don't exist
A circus of light where dreams can take flight
In the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings
