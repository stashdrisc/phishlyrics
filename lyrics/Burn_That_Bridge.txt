Burn That Bridge

Trouble seems to follow me
Like a thoughtless lonely dog
I can't shake it no matter how I run
And you know and I don't
I seen it coming from the sun
There will be lots to say
And hell to pay
Before this day gets done

But I'll bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
There's trouble coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Sunlight in your smile
Seen it twinkling through
I've been on this earth awhile
I've never met no one like you.
But Lord knows I'm a sinner
But something tells me you are too
And I'll pay tomorrow for what I pray
We're about to do

But I'll bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
The trouble's coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Sometimes you got to break the rules
And throw away the book
Touch the candle at both ends
And leave before you look

I may be a little crazy
And lord knows I'm no great catch
But you survive the gasoline
And I'll survive a match

But I'll bridge when I get to it
I know I shouldn't but the spark is lit
If this is trouble, I don't mind a bit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Burn that bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
The trouble's coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Burn that bridge x8
Burn burn burn that bridge x2
