Simple
(Gordon)

We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band
We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band

What is a band without cymbals?
Ooh ooh, cymbals are grand

We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got a saxophone in the band
We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got saxophone in the band

What is a band without saxophone?
Ooh ooh, saxophone is grand

Cymbals and saxophones
Saxophones and cymbals
Cymbals and saxophones
Saxophones and cymbals

We've got Bebop
Cause we've got a band
And we play Bebop in the band

We've got skyscraper
And it sings a pretty tune
'Cuz every band needs skyscraper too

What is a band without skyscraper?
Ooh ooh skyscraper is grand!
