Monica
(Anastasio/Marshall)

You lift me up, you hired me
and light my day, you fired me
But then you stole the sun, delighted me
Now the day is gone, you knighted me 

It's dawning on me how it starts
Your wisdom must be why it smarts
Some wholes sum as many parts
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song 
it really didn't last too long

Sing Sing Monica sing your song
can you admit that you were wrong?
go back home where you belong
Sing Monica, Sing Monica...

You gave me one last taste, retreated me
Then cut me off at the knees, defeated me
From your ivory tower, inspired me
Then stole my manhood, desired me

It's setting in now how it ends
you may have one it all depends
have-nots have as many friends
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song 

it really didn't last too long
Sing Sing Monica sing your song
can you admit that you were wrong?
go back home where you belong

Sadly she set me free...

you charged me up, excited me
upended and re-righted me
you hooked me up, you wired me
but when my tread was worn, retired me

I'm saying all this stuff because
it's finally dawning on me how it was

Sing Monica, Sing Monica...
