Dear Mrs. Reagan
(Jim Pollock/Rich Kleinman)

Dear Mrs. Reagan, I hope you're feeling well 
Fighting drugs and abortion will keep you out of hell 
Send in the troops they'll shut the system down 
Take away their leaders and replace them all with clowns 

Out in the Rose Garden, time for a speech 
Make up your face so it looks like a peach 
Aw, Nancy dear, what shall I say? 
Tell ole Ronnie it's all OK. 

Oh Mrs Reagan, Mrs Reagan 
Gun your husband down 
You'll collect insurance 
Make our country sound 

Dear Mrs Reagan, gun your husband down, 
Save us from this awful fate 
George Bush will be our next president! 
Dear Mr Reagan, your hair is really swell 

Buy another missile and damn the poor to hell 
Pump up our resources, 
You'll make us strong abroad 
Foreign country leaders 

Know that you're a fraud 
Oh Ron, you're such a patriot 
We think that you're an idiot 
Everybody's singing this time 

Oh Mrs Reagan, Mrs Reagan, gun your husband down, 
Don't this let injustice reign, 
It's Ron you must uncrown 
Oh Mrs Reagan, gun your husband down 

Send him out to pasture 
His brain cannot be found
