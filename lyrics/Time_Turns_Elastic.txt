Time Turns Elastic
(Anastasio)

["Submarine"]

In and out of focus
Time turns elastic
In and out of focus
In and out of focus
Time turns elastic
In and out of focus
In and out of focus
Time turns...

And when I'd stayed too long
I went outside and stared
Arms outstretched and long
Moved straight across the sky
(In and out of focus)
(In and out of focus)

If I could wrap my arms around this globe
Hands, touch the green and brown
I'd sink into the cool, cool ground
(In and out of focus)
(In and out of focus)

Seen all, seen all, seen all summer
Seen all, seen all, seen all spring

But I'm a submarine
submarine sinks below
The ground
a submarine

I'm a submarine
submarine sinks below
The ground

["Landslide"]

Now that the leaves have turned to gold
The moments all glow
Frozen and free from time

And out here on my own
I watch it ebb and flow

Here, with the fire burning low
In the honey mist that breathes
Crooked maple fingers trembling all around
I feel the winds that blow

Out here between the dark and light
The summer's gone, and the reeds bow down
As the colors change
All along the water line

oooohhhhhh

And when it's time the landslide will free what froze inside
While all around the rocks collide
You finally see the lines
That point toward the light that never dies

Melody, shelter in the darkness
Take hold of me now
Memory, trapped in a corner
Dark fingers are long

But all around streaming down
Rays of blue light, calling out

["Silver Sound Shower"]

These silver sounds are raining down on me
Here on the wheel, the rhythm’s turning all around
Up above the darkened sky is bleeding
I feel the world turning upside down

["Funnels"]

These are the reasons that we lay down on the ground
Drawn through a funnel, all the colors run together
Turning brown

Wait for the waves to come and carry me away
Down on the ground the sounds of voices in the echoes seem to say

["Carousel"]

And as the carousel circles unceasingly
Watch while the ripples decay in this rolling time
And cascading, the winds set the wheels in motion
And it’s turning in the mist around me
Rolling and turning into the mist around me

Kissed by the water and held in your mother’s arms
Green where you tumble and roll in these fields
The shapes of the bodies that shift in the sun
While the blossoms all scream and it sleeps around me
The earth in these memories heals around me

In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns

Touches these woods and these waters all paved with gold
Gleaming in daylight the voices ring on
They pull while the pointing lay down in the storm
And this life is bending and swelling around me

Rolling and turning into the mist around me
The winds all rising in the west around me
And the carousel turns into breath around me

In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
