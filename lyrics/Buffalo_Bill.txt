Buffalo Bill

"Looking for owls?" 
The young man asked
Hoping to lighten the tension
And the scowl he received 
as his only reply
Made him smile 
as he relived the mention

And the coward fool 
walked on alone
Quite proud of the fear he instilled
And later they found him
tied to a log
Bent over and buffalo billed
