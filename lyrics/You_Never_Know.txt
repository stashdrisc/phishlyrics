You Never Know
(Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell)

It's on the way, you never know
It's on the way, you never know

Tried to get away but they just kept comin'
Landed the jet with the limo runnin'
With a bird on my shoulder, they showed no pity
Left the cage at home and went to Mexico City

It's on the way, you never know
It's on the way, you never know

Stars and players, I knew them all
Crystal bottles lined the wall
Rob from Peter to pay for Paul
They watched me rise but didn't stick around to see me fall

And it's here, and it's now
And it's here, and it's now

Checking all those names right off your list
Until there was no one left to call
Money buys you friends, but friendsâ€™ money don't buy you much at all

Came so close, I had it all
It felt so good before the fall
I saw it come but I let it go
But I just met two guys with piles of cash in Mexico

You never know, you never know
You never know, you never know

Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
