Destiny Unbound

Highway Bill's on the rotary still
and he can't even feel the pain
Of a sun dried shoulder and a scar from a boulder
that cut him right across his vein
Now he's suckin' cigar and he's shovelin' tar
in the crater of a turnpike terrain
He's got only one hope, and he wants to elope,
'cuz Highway Jill is driving him insane.

We gotta get on the road, destiny unbound
She's the one for me we gotta get outta town
We gotta get on the road, destiny unbound
She's the one for me we gotta get outta town
Highway Jill was a daffodil with a cactus sense of pride
At the wheel of a tractor, she was quite an impactor
When the road rocks started to slide
She saw Bill drop his shovel on a pile of gravel
As he climbed up out of his ditch
She was wonderstruck when he climbed in her truck
He said "I've been havin' this everlasting itch

Chorus:
At first she was cold, she was ready to scold
This guy from the pit with a thing in his head
But then she thought twice when he melted her ice
With his passionate eyes she was energized!
She started the ignition and without permission
The two of 'em flew down the dusty road
But the road wasn't finished and the pavement diminished
They soared off the edge and they plunged in the sludge

She said: There isn't even any road, our Destiny was bound
We were the ones for us but now we're in the ground
