46 Days

Leigh Fordham sold me out
46 days and the coal ran out
Please come round here another day
Sit yourself down when you're ready to stay

She dug down when they took the town
Lookin' for clues but they couldn't be found
Leigh found out she was ready to roam
47 days and the coal came home

Taste the fear 
For the devil's drawing near
