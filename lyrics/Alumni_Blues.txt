Alumni Blues

Woke up this morning 
And I had those Walking Blues
Woke up this morning 
And I had those Walking Blues
I wasn't walkin' nowhere 'cause I didn't have no legs!

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!

Staring over the edge of the bed
My old lady turned to me and she started to cry
Staring over the edge of the bed
My old lady turned to me and she started to cry
She said "I'm gonna take this diploma,
I'm gonna slice you in the eye!"

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!

[Additional Lyrics]

Escaping through my window
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home
Escaping through my window
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home
I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam

So I'm sittin' in this cell
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth
So I'm sittin' in this cell
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth
I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least it's got a floor!

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!
