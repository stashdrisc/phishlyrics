Discern
(Anastasio/Marshall)

The sounds of flying swiftly, which makes it hard to find
The pathway through the darkness, every time I fall behind

I think I hear a whisper, around nearly every turn
But what the voice is saying, I barely can discern

The echoes that are following, the contours of the ground
Ebb and flow and eddies in a title wave of sound

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground
Ebb and flow and eddies in a title wave of sound

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning the of expressions I barely can discern
