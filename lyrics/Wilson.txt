Wilson

Oh out near Stonehenge, I lived alone
Oh out near Gamehendge, I chafed a bone
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

Talk my duke a mountain, Helping Friendly Book
Inasfar as fiefdom, I think you bad crook
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

I talked to Mike Christian, Rog and Pete the same
When we had that meeting, over down near Game(hendge)
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

You got me back thinkin' that you're the worst one
I must inquire, Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
