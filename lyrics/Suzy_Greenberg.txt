Suzy Greenberg
(Anastasio/Pollak)

Little Suzy Greenberg, with her head caved in
Soon to let me drown beneath the undertow
You better put that woman in a looney bin
'Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show

Suzy is an artist, she paints quite a lot
An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
She says she wants to be a sociologist
But she better first get checked by a neurologist

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg
Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg

Suzy's 'bout as faithful as a slot machine
Pays off once in a while, but then she robs you clean
She's always afraid that she's not sure what she's worth
She's out of her mind, and she's not of this Earth

The woman walks the streets like she's the queen of the town
Doesn't talk very much, she's very profound
Little Suzy Greenberg, always playing a game
But today I bet she's probably forgot my name!

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy

An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
