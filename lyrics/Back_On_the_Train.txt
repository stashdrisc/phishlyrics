Back on the Train 

When I jumped off I had a bucket full of thoughts
When I first jumped off I held that bucket in my hand
Ideas that would take me all around the world
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl
It took me a long time to get back on the train

Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again
I'm gone and I'll never look back at all
You know I'll never look back again
I turn my face into the howling wind
It took me a long time to get back on the train

See my face in the town that's flashing by
See me standing in the station in the rain
See me running there beside the car
I left it all behind me and I've traveled far
It took me a long time to get back on the train
