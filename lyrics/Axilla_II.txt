Axilla (Part II)

Summer sitting out by the pool
A ray of sunshine getting in my way
Close your eyes and wish that it were cool
Everyday

And I wish it could be back the other way
But what's dissolved ain't coming back today
Close your eyes and wish that it were
Close your eyes and wish that it were

Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla

Never understood what my body was for
That's why I always leave it layin' out on the floor
The shape of curiosity
Where different faces fit before

Tracing my image in the sand
To pass the time from slip to fall
The line I trace begins to weave
A tangled web from wall to wall 

Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla
Axilla
Axilla
