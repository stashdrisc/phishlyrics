Billy Breathes

Tumbling greens
A pickup screams
Alone above the square
Oh sing softly

Above the trees
Where Billy breathes
We float upon the air

Softly sing sweet songs

Silent scenes
In motion means
I’ll wake you when we’re there
Oh sing softly

Time, it seems
In broken dreams
To sleep beside the stair
