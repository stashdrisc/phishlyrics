Waiting All Night
(Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell)

Up all night and I'm waiting for you to come home
Waiting all night
Waiting all night
Mind is racing and I'm wondering what I did wrong
Waiting all night
Waiting all night

Where could you be
I'm so alone
Won't you please come home

Sun's coming up 
and I'm rolling over
But I'm holding on

Waiting all night
And I said I'm sorry
Waiting all night
But you went so far away
Waiting all night
Donâ€™t know why you
Waiting all night 
Left me this way
Waiting all night
Just sail on, sail on
