Carini
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell)

I saw you with Carini and that piece of ass
You built your house with windows 
but those windows had no glass
Lucy had a lumpy head
Lucy took a walk, now Lucy's dead

[Alternate first verse:
I saw you with Carini and that naked dude
I couldn't eat my food
Lucy had a lumpy head
Lucy took a walk, now Lucy's dead]

You told me of a secret place
I saw it when I met you
the walrus on your face
Aghilla scared the shit out of the ram

The thesis that you're writing is a load of shit
But I'm glad you finally finished it
You went across the street and he called his dad
Now you'll never get the raise you thought you had

The people all were screaming when they saw the lump
Everyone was screaming when they saw the lump
Aghilla scared the shit out of the ram

Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head
