Wading in the Velvet Sea
(Anastasio, Marshall)

I took a moment from my day
Wrapped it up in things you say
Mailed it off to your address
You'll get it pretty soon soon unless

The packaging begins to break
and all the points I tried to make
are tossed like thoughts into a bin
as time leaks out, my life leaks in

You wonâ€™t find moments in a box
and someone else will set your clocks
I took a moment from my day
and wrapped it up in things you say
And mailed it off to you

I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the, I've been wading in the...
I've been wading in the velvet sea
