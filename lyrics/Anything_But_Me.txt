Anything But Me
(Anastasio, Marshall, Herman)

I am just a satellite
high above the atmosphere
Bouncing every thing you say
to someone who is meant to hear
Sometimes on a rainy day
I lie in bed and dream of you
So blame it on the satellite
when your message can't get through

I am just a tiny wave
a minor ripple out at sea
Moving slowly towards the shore
burdened with uncertainty
I'm gaining power
losing speed
wondering as I near your door
Will you hold it open 
for the tidal wave approaching shore?

You've become an island 
in the hazy world surrounding me
Offering a vast reward 
each time I safely cross the sea
All too often I become lost 
in the fog and haze
Clinging still
against my will
to promises of clearer days

I am just a raindrop 
that accelerates without control
Losing bits and pieces in descent 
'til I'm no longer whole
I am just another shooting star 
above that you might see
Until I have your full attention 
I'll be anything but me
