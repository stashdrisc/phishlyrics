Character Zero

I was taught a month ago
to bide my time and take it slow
then I learned just yesterday
to rush and never waste the day

I'm convinced the whole day long
that all I learn is always wrong
and things are true that I forget
but no one taught that to me yet

I ought to see the man Mulcahy
