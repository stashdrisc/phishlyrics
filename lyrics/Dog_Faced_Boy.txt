Dog Faced Boy

I can't spare a moment for the dog faced boy
I won't lend another hand to theworm girl of Hanoi
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you

Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Whenever I think of you, the best friend I ever had...
Before I gave it up all for nothing
Well, I lied and I cheated

And it made me feel bad
It made me feel guilty for not being true
Oh the months I spend trying for a way to explain
In the end all I could do as turn my head in shame
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Because you deserve better and once I was it
But somehow my good intentions just got up and git
