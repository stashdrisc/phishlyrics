The Curtain With
(Anastasio/Daubert)

As he saw his life run away from him
Thousands ran along
Chanting words from a song

Please me, have no regrets
Please me, have no regrets

Came from the baby's mouth
We follow the lines going south

Please me, have no regrets

Came from the, came from the, came from the... baby's mouth!
We follow the lines going south!

(Same as: The Curtain)
