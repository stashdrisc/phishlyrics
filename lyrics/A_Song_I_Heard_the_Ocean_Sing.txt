A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing


A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide
And both they soothed me in my sleep

 
For every season that has passed
I prayed a prayer into the tide
A shining light in darkness deep
In my ten years before the mast

 

For every season that has passed
I laid my body o’er the side
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide

 
How can I answer questions I’ve known?


A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
Ten years before the mast
I heard the ocean sing
