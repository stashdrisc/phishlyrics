Sleep
(Anastasio/Marshall)

I can't describe the feeling when
I'm in my bed asleep and then
I wake up with a vision blurred
and all my efforts are deterred
to reconstruct this image lost

there're certain things my mind won't do
and even though they're very few
the image glistens like a gem
repairing is not one of them

so I'm awake though in my mind
the image that so unrefined
is calling to me from the deep
tempting me to fall asleep
