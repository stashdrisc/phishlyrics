Olivia's Pool
(Anastasio, Marshall)

The terrible thing about hell
is that when you're there you can't even tell
as you move throught this life you love so
you could be there and not even know

but you say so what I'm doing just fine
the irony is that it's all in your mind
and that is why hell is so vicious and cruel
but you'll just go on an oblivious fool
