Weigh

I'd like to cut your head off so I could weigh it
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

I'd like to go to your house 
and gather all your razors 
and pick all the little prickly hairs 
so I can weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

I'd like to gather all your friends 
and smoosh them into a small swimming pool 
so I could weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

Why weigh on a sunny day?
So much to do so why oh why weigh?
On a sunny day, why oh why weigh?
Why weigh, why weigh?

I'd like to hear my options
so I could weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

Why weigh on a sunny day?
So much to do, so why oh why weigh? 
On a sunny day, why oh why weigh?
Why oh why oh why...
