Golgi Apparatus

I look into the finance box
Just to check my status
I look into the microscope
See Golgi Apparatus

Golgi, oh, woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi, olgi, oh ooo olgi
Golgi
Golgi

They call him Lysosome
Cause he runs so fast
Runs like a junkyard dog
With a brain of brass

I saw you
With a ticket stub in your hand
Under the light
Middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong
So I had to
