My Problem Right There
(Anastasio, Green)

Didn’t get no sleep last night
I was thinking about today
Try to keep things simple
But my brain gets in the way

I said you need to rest now
But my big head don’t care
Now I can see
That that’s gonna be 
My problem right there

My problem right there
My problem right there
My powerful mind 
is my problem right there

I got no other problems
Of which I’m aware
I’m just too damn smart
That’s my problem right there

Now Peaches from Tulsa
Is calling again
I remember the time
I went home with her friend

Now they both say they’re coming
To be my side
Ain’t no room in this truck
To take three for a ride

My problem right there
My problem right there
These women round here
Are my problem right there

And I could handle them all
But they don’t like to share
I got too much love
That’s my problem right there

Now I could stay up all night
No problem, ok
But I’m often inclined
To sleep through the day

In the shade of the heat
I can nap anywhere
And that’s gonna be
My problem right there

My problem right there
My problem right there
Brains, women and sleep
Are my problem right there

Now look what this cap
Has now done to my hair
(Looks like you got)
(One more problem right there)

Now I drank the last pull
From my best corn liquor
Got nothing to eat
But this half melted Snickers

And the bills they just keep 
coming quicker and quicker
And that ‘ol bill collector
He gets slicker and slicker

And Mr Policeman
Is looking for me
And I got this strange rash
Ain’t no sting from a bee

But I got no other problems
Of which I’m aware
Except I’ve lost everything
And I don’t really care

My problem right there
My problem right there
These problems right here
Are my problem right there

And they’ll probably keep coming
‘Til I stop breathing air
Then that’s gonna be
My biggest problem right there

Problem right there
My problem right there
(My problem right there) x3
