Alaska

I Always had to tell her to relax
I Always had to tell her to relax
I Always had to tell her to relax
And a cat can slip indoors, through multitudes of cracks
but it's funny what they'll do
Cause cracks lead outside too
When I asked her where she's going she said "far away from you"

Stuck here on my own now
Digging down deep
I don't understand it
But I ain't losing sleep
I'm not gonna lay down
I'll head north out of town
I don't know but I think I'll go and try dog mushing with an eskimo

In Alaska, Alaska, I think I'll try Alaska
Somewhere she could wait for me
I'll catch up just wait and see
Idaho, Nebraska, I don't know, Alaska
I think I'll try, I think I'll try Alaska

I sold my old piano for the rent
I loaded up on bug spray
I found my daddy's tent
And now I'm in high gear
Doing forty-five
Humming a tune
I won't see the moon 'til sometime in July

I guess I could have flown or took a train
But you won't see a moose if you're sitting on a plane
And now there's no more road
But I got a light load
Anf If she isn't in Alaska
I'll stay and pan for gold

In Alaska, Alaska, I think I'll try Alaska
Somewhere she could wait for me
I'll catch up just wait and see
Idaho, Nebraska, I don't know, Alaska
I think I'll try, I think I'll try Alaska

Just when I though I'd end up alone
Big ol' 'Laskan mama, come walkin' down the road

Alaska, Alaska,
I'll stay right here in Alaska
All settled down and having fun
Here in the land of the midnight sun
Is it time to call the pastor?
I don't know, I'll ask her
I'll stay right here, I'll stay right here
