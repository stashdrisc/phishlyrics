Halfway to the Moon

I close my eyes as the curtain draws
Ear toward the tracks
And ever after the rhythm soars
Flyin' right past the facts
Hold the times that I brought to light
Keep the pattern till June
Make the other side right
Half the way to the Moon
Im old enough to repeat myself
Im not tryin' to defend
Holdin' onto the thoughts I have
Back to circles again
Holdin' back the emotion train
Headin' back to Duluth
All aboard for the tour
Ridin' next to the truth

I found a place that I cant explain
In my state of mind
I move myself as I search the stone
For any lines to unwind
I grabbed some change when I thought I could
Left my wallet behind
I did my best to refine
I put my shoes out to shine
A little star that reveals itself
Little matter of time
Holdin' on to the thoughts I have/wheel I know
Not the devil I'll find
Raise the bar and roofbeams high
Help me carry this tune
Make the other side right
Half the way to the moon
