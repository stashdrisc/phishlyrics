Mountains In the Mist
(Anastasio, Marshall)

several times unconsciously I’ve stumbled on the path
and seen a mountain in the mist
rain falls on my shoulders, sun rises in the east
I’m worn and bruised, but I am here at least

I guess I’m just an obstacle, a thing to overcome
If I can sneak around myself again, I’ll know I’ve won
The moment seems to hang and float, before me with no end
‘til I’m released awaken beasts, I’m on the road again

and now I’m soaring far too high
a fleck of dust up in the sky
where tiny clouds go sailing by
pull me down today
