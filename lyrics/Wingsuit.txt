Wingsuit

Steal away, let’s steal a car
You’ll never win a major only shooting par
Step outside, feel the sun
It’s only you, be you, ‘cause you’re the only one

And it feels good ‘cause it feels good
And it feels good

Nothing lasts, nothing stays
Caught in this procession of unchanging days
What’s new is old, what’s old is gone
You’re pushed up to the edge, so put your wingsuit on

Put your wingsuit on
(And it feels good ‘cause it feels good
And it feels good)

And gliding away, you fly where you choose
There’s nothing to say and nothing to lose

Steal away, paint the sky

Put your wingsuit on

And gliding away, you fly where you choose
There’s nothing to say, and nothing to lose

Time to put your wingsuit on
