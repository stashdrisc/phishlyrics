What Things Seem
(Gordon)

You float above the traffic in your pickup truck
You always find some magic when you’re running out of luck
I thought you might be driving back to me
It seems I can’t rely on what I see

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things aren’t always what they seem

I caught you mixing potions in your yard
You might have times before but I wasn’t looking hard
Now I’m lost in the haze in clouds of rising steam
I fall on the moss and hear you laughing at me

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things aren’t always what they seem

Confronting you I had to hear the truth
I confessed my suspicions like a sinner in a booth
You ask if I was sure of what I’d seen
You turn and walk off on the mossy green

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things aren’t always what they seem

(I might want you back with me)
