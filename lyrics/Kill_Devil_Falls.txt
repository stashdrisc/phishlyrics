Kill Devil Falls
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Just got back from Kill Devil Falls
Draped my water-logged clothes in the hall
Reach for a beer, glad that I’m here
When I realize that you’re not around

Turned on some music and then the tv
Go through the pile of mail waiting for me
Something I spied makes me pull it aside
A letter from your hometown

How could you leave me?
You heard what I said
I’d be at the waterfall clearing my head
Soaking up nature and thinking of you
And leaving’s the last thing I thought you would do
I didn’t plan to stop at the bar
But Kill Devil Falls is really so far
Who knew a day would turn into a week
But I learned my lesson
And I can still remember the last one
But this time will be different
Until I do it again

Stared at the ceiling for over a day
But none of my questions are answered this way
Won’t make any calls
I’ll just bounce off the walls 
‘Til I go back to Kill Devil Falls

I stand at the base of the mountain
Don’t follow me
And I step right up to the cliff side
Better learn how to leap
And I stare straight into the future
Tell me what do you see
That this time’s gonna be different

Don’t go back to Kill Devil Falls
