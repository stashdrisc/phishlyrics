Tube
(Anastasio/Fishman)

An asteroid crashed and nothing burned
it made me wonder:
Do tigers sleep in lily patches? 
Do rhinos run for thunder?

I got an ache in my left ear
I felt a twinge but I still could hear
Made me think I would not be burned
but rather give myself to science
I felt that I could help
To science, I felt that I can help

Paranoid the doctor ran
shouting his graphic translation
A fortnight of turmoil
gang wars and ails of riches
Spewing forth their color
he purposely waited till I was done
to knock on the lavatory door 
accusing me of ruining the fun
he knocked on it some more
The fun, He knocked on it some more

Alloyed suitors drawn inside
an apple or a grape
To put forth a cloud of mercury 
he was run over by a car
on a freeway in Los Angeles 
once the spraying has been done
'Cause there's more pain from necessity
you're a portrait of your past
There's a mummy in the cabinet
Are there no more arrows left?

What's that rubber bottle doing here? 
How's that napkin for a proof?
Ten cents to a dollar now 
for a shelf of pregnant eggs
Robert Palmer is implored to dance, to dance, to dance

It's so stupendous, living in this tube!
