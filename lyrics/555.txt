555
(Gordon/Murawski)

They're tyin' a blindfold cross my eyes
I rest my face down
Skidding on switchbacks near the sides
Gonna try to bust out

Get up, jump out, don't wait, gotta get away
Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day

Sprint on cobblestones past the tracks
They kept my money, and my water
Don’t wanna run ‘cuz I want it back
But I know I really ought to

If I don't break away clean
I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives:
The 555 

They bought my soul for a pile of cash
Everybody else got paid out
They're closing in I gotta dash
I gotta find a way out

Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day
Get up, jump out, don't wait

If I don't break away clean
I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives:
The 555
