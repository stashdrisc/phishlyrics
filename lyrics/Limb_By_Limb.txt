Limb by Limb
(Anastasio/Marshall/Herman)

The shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone 
But when I'm done freezing I want to be alone

Never want my hand cut off 
Never want a hacking cough 
Never need a cliffside push 
Never turn my brain to mush

Always give me what I lack 
Always take the best parts back 
Always recognize your fate 
Always just a moment late 

Left is where I always turn 
Left is how I'm forced to learn 
Left the route my walking takes 
Left alone with my mistakes 

Up against a person who 
Up 'til now I never knew 
Up from hell the answer blew 
Up and down it's up to you. 

Drop me off the chinese wall 
and peel my fingers off the rim
I come unglued while in mid-air 
and land to reform 
limb by limb 

And I am taken far away....

Lingering slowly and melting away
Tossed with the salad and baled with the hay
Pooling like water that drips from above
Trampled by lambs and pecked by the dove
