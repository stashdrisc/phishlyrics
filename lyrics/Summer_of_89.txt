Summer of '89 (Eighty-nine)
(Anastasio, Green)


We danced all night
And swam at dawn
In the summer of '89
And lives stretched out
Like a rolling ball
In the summer of '89

I see you standing there
In that dress you used to wear
You stole my heart
But I didn't mind
In the summer of '89

Brazilian music on the stereo
We hiked the long trail to a spring
I took blades of grass
And I wove you a ring

Our eyes were bright
But our smiles were worn
In the summer of '95
On the road
When our first was born
In the summer of '95 (ninety-five)

We'd sing to put her down
As the bus rolled out of town
We were driving blind
No clue where we'd arrive
In the summer of '95

Life changes, time presses on
It seems each year goes faster than the last
No, it's not that I don't like the way things are
But lately time just drives me right back to the past

Glad to find any time alone
And it's summer once again
The days are whole
But they're not our own
Remember our life back then.

We shared one small room
And a bed and a chair
I close my eyes
You touch my hand
You smile
And I'm there

You're the same girl I loved back then
For now and all time
You'll be that girl of mine
In the summer of '89

And we danced all night
And we danced all night
