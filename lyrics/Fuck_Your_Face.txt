Fuck Your Face


I went down to the guitar store and I got myself some things
Then I went home to fix this guitar to see if it could sing
When I got done I plugged it in but it made no sound at all
So I was gettin' pretty pissed so I plugged it into the wall

Guess it's not a singing type, it would rather yell and spit.
If you don't think you'll like this guitar then you're really askin' for shit!
`Cause when I get mad, I get red, and then I start to steam.
And this guitar is gonna fuck your face `cause it knows how to scream!

Hi, Im Bill. I was the one who did the cover art for the Stones Sucking in the 70s lp
