Waste

Don't want to be an actor, pretending on the stage
Don't want to be a writer with my thought out on the page
Don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look
Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book

Don't want to be a farmer, working in the sun
Don't want to be an outlaw, always on the run
Don't want to be a climber, reaching for the top
Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop

A dream it's true
But I'd see it through
If I could be
Wasting my time with you

So if I'm inside your head
Don't believe what you might have read
You'll see what I might have said
To hear it
Come waste your time with me
