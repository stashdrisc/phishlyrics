Free

I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot
of swimming weightless in the womb
or bouncing gently 'round the room
In a minute I’ll be free
and you’ll be splashing in the sea

I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me
in a minute I'll be free
and you'll be splashing in the sea
we'll hear a tiny cry
as the ship goes sliding by
