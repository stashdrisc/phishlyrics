Twenty Years Later

I can hold my breath for a minute or so
Five days without food is as long as I’ll go
I didn’t sleep once for four days and three nights
I once didn’t stop for seven red lights
I jumped into water that’s fifty degrees
I rowed in a kayak in thirty-foot seas
I stayed in the woods for a week with a knife
A flint when I lost it nearly cost me my life
Twenty years later…
I’m still upside down

It’s a small world
And it’s turning real fast
(Here upside down)
It’s a new day 
And the mourning has passed
(Turned upside down)
It’s a short road
But the mountains are tall
(Land upside down)
It’s a small world
But we all start out small

I hurtle through air though I feel I’m alone
I stick with the others to the skin of the stone
I stop for a stranger just to give him a lift
I cling like a lizard to the side of the cliff
I treat every minute like an hour and then
It seems like a year has just flashed by again
We build a foundation but where do we stand
When all air is water and all water is land

Twenty years later…
I’m still upside down

It’s a small world
And it’s turning real fast
(Here upside down)
It’s a new day 
And the mourning has passed
(Turned upside down)
It’s a short road
But the mountains are tall
(Land upside down)
It’s a small world
But we all start out small

Feel it turning in circles
And you’re never the same again
Spin slowly while sounds cascade 
And became
I’m here upside down

Inside this silent scene
All are free, all are free
Second time around
