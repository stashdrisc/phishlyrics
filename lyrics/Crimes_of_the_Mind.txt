Crimes of the Mind
(Pollak)

Bigger than man walking on the moon
Coming to a theatre near you soon
This is what I'm living for
You get a little bit
And you want a little more

Everything is fine
Crimes of the mind
I drink a little wine
Crimes of the mind
Here's to modern times
Crimes of the mind

Every dog will have its day
And all these dogs just want to play
You will reap what you sow
But the real truth we will never know

Everything is fine
Crimes of the mind
I drink a little wine
Crimes of the mind
Here's to modern times
Crimes of the mind

Rolling in the grime
Crimes of the mind
Digging for a dime
Crimes of the mind
Blind leading the blind
Crimes of the mind
