Thunderhead
(Anastasio, Marshall)

I need a new way to express myself
So you don't need to guess
What otherwise I'd say aloud
And watch it float just like a cloud

High up above you like a thunderhead
But you would just look down instead
And wait 'til foggy skies abate
And vapor clouds all dissipate

And when with them all my words for you
Have softly sublimated too
And you'll just hope that I've moved on
So you'll look up and find me gone
