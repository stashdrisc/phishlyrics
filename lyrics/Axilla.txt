Axilla
(Anastasio/Marshall/Herman)

I dropped the buzzard in the sand and strode off slowly toward the town
I needed dinner and a place where I could throw my weight around
I detected faint axilla scent that put me off my appetite
But mouflon warring where I went renewed in me a need to fight

Then reveling in mirror mask I soon was lost in foggy ditch
Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch
Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze
My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways

I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs
I pulled the witch from out the ditch and turned to face the furry thugs
The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam
The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream
I gulped and felt my loins dissolve!!!
