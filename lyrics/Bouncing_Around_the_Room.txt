Bouncing Around the Room

The woman was a dream I had
Though rather hard to keep
for when my eyes were watching hers
They closed,
And I was still asleep.

For when my hand was holding hers
She whispered words and I awoke
And faintly bouncing around the room
The echo of whomever spoke
I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room
the echo of whomever spoke.

The place I sought was far beneath
The surface of the sea
My sight was poor
But I was sure
The sirens sang their songs for me
They dance above me as I sink
I see them through a crystal haze
And hear them bouncing round the room
the never ending coral maze
