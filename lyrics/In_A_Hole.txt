In A Hole

It happened to me at the water tower
I was on my way home on a misty night
Dreaming of dinner and a shower
A chill in the air, there wasn’t a soul in sight
When I stepped on a stick
I started to slip
And I fell in a hole

Well it seemed that the hole was never-ending
And deeper I fell into the silent black
Picking up speed my body bending
I was starting to think that I would never come back
When the air became thick
The air became cold
And everything froze

I tried to move but wasn’t able
I found myself frozen in a block of ice
I pictured by dinner on the table
A plate of asparagus would sure taste nice
When everything shook
The ice began to crack
And I felt it explode

I knew that at last I had escaped the violence
And headed for home as fast as I could run
I felt myself floating in the silence
And I pictured the water tower and the rising sun
But I didn’t look down
I stepped on a stick
And I fell in a hole

I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole
