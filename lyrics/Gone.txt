Gone

Running from yourself
Come back from the dead
All those sleepless nights
All that pain
I'm sorry you're gone
But you're gone

When hope is nearly lost
You'll finally do what's right
Stop bleeding from your head anymore
The devil has you down
So turn around
And rise into the light

Running from yourself
(Spinning got you here)
Come back from the dead
(And there's no sun left in your eyes)
All those sleepless nights, all that pain
(You looked right through me)
I'm sorry you're gone
But you're gone
Left alone sleeping

When hope is nearly lost
(Gave with all your strength)
You'll finally do what's right
(Spoke with your eyes closed)
Stop bleeding from your head anymore
(I saw you dreaming like a child)
The devil has you down
(Cross the river with your friends)
So turn around
And rise into the light
(And rise into the light)
