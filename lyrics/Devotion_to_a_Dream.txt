Devotion to a Dream

No more promises that no one could keep
No more lies to keep us from sleep
No more phone calls when you don't say what you mean
I've got faith in a fairytale, devotion to a dream

It's today the vows are broken
It's today the charade is over
It's today the curtain's coming down

Now the battle-lines are chosen
It's today my eyes are open
It's today the time to turn around

No more knowing glances or places we can hide
No more chances to keep this thing alive
The two of us together it wasn't in the grand scheme
All it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
Devotion to a dream

No more promises no more keeping score
No more wondering what I stay here for
We broke the awkward silence with polite and practiced lies
While images occupied our minds

An uneventful voyage that stranded us upstream 
All it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
Devotion to a dream

Yesterday my path was chosen
Yesterday my smile was frozen
Yesterday my doors were closing down

Tomorrow I can cross the border
It's today a new world-order
Yesterday my will was broken down

I'll ignore where this is leading
Tomorrow glaciers are receding
Now I'm mending things I broke inside

I'm completing thoughts unspoken
Now I see that webs were woven
Now I keep the windows open wide

It's today
