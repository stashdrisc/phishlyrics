The Connection
(Anastasio/Marshall)

When I see the connection
Though I see I don’t stare
Though I see I don’t stare

When I’m lost in my reflection
Though I see I don’t stare
Though I see I don’t stare

Then I change my direction
One foot follows the other
One foot follows something new
’Cause I need some protection
And I’m scared I could lose it
If I stare, you’ll be gone

When I need some attention
Though I see I don’t stare
Though I see I don’t stare

When I’m lost in my reflection
Though I see I don’t stare
Though I see I don’t stare
