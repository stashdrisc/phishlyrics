Down With Disease

Down with disease
Three weeks in my bed
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head

Down with disease
Up before the dawn
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn
and I keep...

Waiting for the time when I can finally say
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop

Down with disease and the jungles in my mind
They're climbing up my waterfalls and swingin' on my vines
So I try to hear the music but I'm always losing time
'Cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're stealin' all my lines
Stealin' all my lines and I keep

Waiting for the time when I can finally say
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop
