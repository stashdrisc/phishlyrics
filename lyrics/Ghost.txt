Ghost

I feel I've never told you 
the story of the ghost 
that I once knew and talked to 
of whom I'd never boast

But this was my big secret
how I get ahead
and never have to worry
I'd call him instead

His answer came in actions
He never spoke a word
Or maybe I lay down the phone 
before he could be heard

I somehow feel forsaken
Like he had closed the door
I guess I just stopped needing him
as much as once before

But maybe he's still with me 
the latch was left unhooked
He's waiting in the wind and rain
I simply haven't looked
