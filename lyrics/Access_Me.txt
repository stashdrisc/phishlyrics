Access Me
(Gordon)

The first time I came over I was bitten by your dog
You weren’t even there ’cause you were walking in the fog
I call you up and plead and beg and talk to your machine
My friends say not to bother when you’re acting pretty mean

But I don’t need to bother you, no I won’t play that part
I just want access to the inside of your heart
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me
Access me

You could tell me all about all the things you did at work
The guy who sits beside you and how he’s acting like a jerk
And you don’t have to open up the secrets of your soul
But if that’s the place you want me I’d be glad to pay the toll
