NICU
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Appendages flailing, you're running at me
Ferocious tenaciously, clawing at me
The devious gelatin holding me fast
Miraculous now, you let me ooze past

Over the wall, rushing rivers of sleaze
The tip of stalactites incising my knees
A slipper, a sand dollar, day at the shore
Nice evening at home that I dread even more

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

Back on those days when my life was a haze
The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank
From the free mason's crank to the overflow tank

Bane of the weasel for biting/biding is fun
Jump on the turnstile and watch me go round
Swim with the cactus and float with the stone
I try to convey what you strive to condone

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

...Play it Leo!!

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

Would you please (No left turn unstoned) make clear to me (When you see me)
Why nothing is the first thing that I see
And if you do (No left turn unstoned) And I see you (When you see me)
Then you will be the nothing left for me

Would you please (No left turn unstoned) make clear to me (When you see me)
Why nothing is the first thing that I see
And if you do (No left turn unstoned) And I see you (When you see me)
Then you will be the nothing left for me
