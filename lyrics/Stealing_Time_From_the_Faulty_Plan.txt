Stealing Time from the Faulty Plan
(Anastasio/Marshall/Herman)

Got a blank space where my mind should be
Got a Clif Bar and some cold green tea
Got clouds that seem to follow me
Got strange demands piled up on me
Got memories
Memories of being free

Gonna steal time from the faulty plan
Gonna act as though Iâ€™m still a man
Gonna give you one last chance to see
Gonna shrug demands off of me
Gonna dream
Dream of being free

Gonna steal time from the faulty plan
Got a blank space where my mind should be
