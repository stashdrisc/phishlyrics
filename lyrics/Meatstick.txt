Meatstick
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell)

I'm trapped here as my senses bleed 
I can't recall which things I need 
You show up late and stumble in 
Unsure if you are still Corrine 

My captive gaze inside your eyes 
Reveal a thing you've tried to hide 
Attempting to record this view 
Reflections drive me out of you 

Time for the meatstick, 
Bury the meatstick, 
Take out the meatstick time 
Whoa, shocks my brain 
Whoa, shocks my brain 

Time for the meatstick, 
Bury the meatstick, 
Take out the meatstick time 
Whoa, shocks my brain 
Whoa, shocks my brain 

But long before this scene concludes
The end I'm seeking still eludes 
My every effort to apply 
My will to moments passing by

But everytime we say goodbye 
The pain I can't identify 
Reveals to me the hidden door
That leads to several moments more 

Time for the meatstick, 
Bury the meatstick, 
Take out the meatstick time 
Whoa, shocks my brain 
Whoa, shocks my brain 

(Japanese lyrics by the Boredoms)
Meatosticku jiuando
Meatosticku kakushite
Meatosticku toridashta, jiuan
Do do atamaga shock
Do do atamaga shock
