Winterqueen
(Anastasio, Marshall)

The winter queen looks up and sighs:
I wish that I controlled the skies
for up above is where to stand
to rule those who walk on the land

The summer queen flies by and sees
her realm of butterflies and bees
and said, I wish I lived below
instead I sail where breezes blow 

And the rain came down
it tried to seep
into the ground
but water deep

Pecked and poked
and sodden soil
already soaked
began to roil

The prince of silence walks below
inside a cave of ice and snow
he says "I wonder why?" but words
are locked in glaciers, never heard

The prince of music on guitar
neglects to play a single bar
but music trapped inside his head
resounds and fills the space instead

The winter queen looks up and sighs...
