Jennifer Dances

The workers they come back from their day in the field
Jennifer dances and she cooks me a meal
A little less salt in the gravy tonight

You ought to know from long ago
to listen to the winds that blow
Cause when your past creeps up at last
you'll see the landscape open fast
And you'll be standing on a landing
stumbling despite your demanding
And drawn inside a valley wide
you crossed it with a single stride

You always knew the winds that blew
The workers they come back from their day in the field
The workers they come back from their day in the field
The workers they come back from their day in the field

You always knew the winds that blew
The workers they come back from their day in the field
(Jennifer dances)
The workers they come back from their day in the field
(Jennifer dances)
The workers they come back from their day in the field
(Jennifer dances)

Jennifer dances
Jennifer dances
Jennifer dances
Jennifer dances
