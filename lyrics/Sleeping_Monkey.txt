Sleeping Monkey
(Anastasio, Marshall)

The feeling's not the same
In fact it's getting pretty tame
It's just not that great anymore

I guess I'll go outside
And flag a weasel for a ride
And take it on down to the shore

Wallowing in fear
The days and weeks that you're not here
Was all the waiting in vain?

The day that you arrived
My sleeping monkey is revived
But you sent him home on the train

Home on the train
Why'd you send my monkey on a train?
The day that you arrived
My sleeping monkey is revived
But you sent him home on the train

Home on the train
