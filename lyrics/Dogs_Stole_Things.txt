Dogs Stole Things

Dog stole things I needed bad
Cats took what I never had
Pillows for my aching head
A glass of milk next to my bed

The creatures that seem oh so kind
Then sleep all day and ease your mind
at night they softly pad along
and look to steal things that you own

So now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord that I might keep
my soul for one more night or two
and hope the creatures never do

The creatures that seem oh so kind
Then sleep all day and ease your mind
at night they softly pad along
and look to steal things that you own
