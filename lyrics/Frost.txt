Frost

The mistress of the dawn strides along
With her solitary pawn who lingers on then is gone
With no word and no one heard where he went to this day
Maybe he would sail away

The children of the sun having fun
Didnâ€™t realize they were done because the pawn chanced to wander
Through the camp just like a tramp he left his stamp there to this day
Maybe he would sail away

Gone are silent summer rains
Wind is rolling off the plains
Bringing ice upon the breeze
Making flowing water freeze

The minstrel of the land made a stand in a castle built of sand
Watched it fall in the frost and the message was lost
With one last word to deliver under ice upon the river it lies frozen to this day
Maybe he would sail away
