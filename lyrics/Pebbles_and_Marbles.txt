Pebbles and Marbles
(Anastasio, Marshall)

She started a blaze from one tiny spark
I didn't even detect
She loved the light, was dismayed by the dark
The stars though she seemed to respect

The faint light that flutters at night to the earth
Would land in her eyes and collect
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf
I never thought to inspect

Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone I am inclined
If I find a pebble in sand
To think that it fell from my hand

She gave me ideas
Planted the seed
But she never stopped to reflect
The course that she's on, wherever it leads
I never would redirect

Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end
When we're alone we all seem to tend
If we find a marble in dust
To wish someone left it for us
