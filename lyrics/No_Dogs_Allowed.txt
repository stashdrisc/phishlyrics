No Dogs Allowed
(Anastasio)

No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed 
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

So climb up the stairs 
And be on your way 
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then just think of this place 
A city of dogs living here in this space 
Whining and running from dawn until dark 
My head would be aching from hearing them bark

So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed in the subway today

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the people would shout 
And tell me to order those dirty dogs out 
I'd have to decide who would get to sit down 
Would the dogs or the people ride into town

So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed 
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the trains would be filled 
With creatures that never, no never stand still
There wouldn't be room for the people at all 
The trains would be cluttered with dogs big and small
