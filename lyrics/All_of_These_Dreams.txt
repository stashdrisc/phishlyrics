All of These Dreams 

There is a place on the mountain nearby
Deep in a cave 
but it's up rather high
There in the darkness are safely concealed
All of the dreams 
that you never revealed

And if you go there
and after you do
All of these dreams 
would be yours to pursue
The rest of your lifetime 
devoid of a care
If you keep your eyes open 
you may find yourself there

Such is the promise
such is the curse
You could just live your life 
better or worse
Knowing the cache of dreams 
up on that hill
Beckons and sways 
but won't bend to your will

You might find a river 
under a mountain
That feeds a remote subterranean fountain

Drink from this taste 
just a hint of a dream
That somehow leaked into 
the underground stream
