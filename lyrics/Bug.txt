Bug
(Anastasio, Marshall)

There've been times when I wonder
and times when I don't
concepts I'll ponder
and concepts I won't ever see

God isn't one of these
former or latter
which did you think I meant?
It doesn't matter to me

Bug – don't need it
Bug – don't feed it
my thoughts faded
it doesn't matter/overrated

Cold in my hand
in a country pool
standing and waving
the rain, wind on the runway

Spending or saving
credit or debt
which did you think I meant?
Nothing I see can be taken from me

Bug – don't need it
Bug – don't feed it
my thoughts faded
it doesn't matter/overrated
