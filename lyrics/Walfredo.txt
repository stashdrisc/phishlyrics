Walfredo

It must be ten years since I saw you
Grooving at Hunt's with El-Rayo X
Lindley's hair was so greasy
Who knew then what would happen next

We were eating crab at Merriweather Post
We went up to that mountain in Stowe
We played in a field in New Mexico

Walfredo, where did you go?

What did you do?
Who put you up to it?
Where did you go?
How much did you get paid?
How do you do?
How did you know where I lived?

Next time we saw Karl and Raul
Rodney had taken your place
He played like the wind and the water
But we still missed your smiling face

And when we finally made it to Trento
Ooh Rocko William had taken the throne
Stood on the field next to Davey
Ooh just to keep him from feeling alone

What did you do?
Who put you up to it?
Where did you go?
How much did you get paid?
How do you do?
How did you know where I lived?

No one has had more chances than you
Life isn't fair, what can you do?
Alex had more chances than...

Now when I think back on you, Walfredo
Those were times I'll never forget
The snow fell in Vail, Colorado
When Fish played the vacuum and ruined your set

...back to Walfredo
Leaning back on your stool
Looking cool behind that paint splatter kit
But not as cool as Raul

What did you do?
Who put you up to it?
Where did you go?
How much did you get paid?
How do you do?
How did you know where I lived?
