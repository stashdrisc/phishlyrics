Sanity
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell/Pollak)

Sanity never came my way
(came his way)
sanity never came my way
(his way)
I don't know what I'll do today
(way)
'Cause sanity never came my way

Lost my mind just a couple of times
(lost his mind)
lost my mind just a couple of times
(his mind)
you can spend your nickels, you can spend your dimes
(mind)
but I lost my mind just a couple of times

You can trespass anywhere
(a-ny-where)
You can trespass anywhere
(ny-where)
but where you go, you'd better beware
(where)
you can trespass anywhere

I forgot the rules, I forgot my pride
('got his pride)
but I don't need a place to hide
(his pride)
I forgot the rules, I forgot my pride
(pride)
But I don't need a place to hide!

The stars in the sky are very bright
(stars are bright)
the stars in the sky are very bright
(are bright)
the stars they really suck tonight!
(stars suck)
the stars in the sky are very bright

And I don't care if the world explodes
(world ex-plodes)
No, I don't care if the world explodes.
(ex-plodes)
You can save the whales, you can save the toads
(Toads)
But I don't care if the world explodes!

Boom! Pow! 
Boom! Pow! 
Boom! Pow!
Boom! Pow!

Sanity never came my way
(came his way)
sanity never came my way
(his way)
I don't know what I'll do today
(way)
'Cause sanity never came my way

Lost my mind just a couple of times
(lost his mind)
lost my mind just a couple of times
(his mind)
you can spend your nickels, you can spend your dimes
(mind)
but I lost my mind...
