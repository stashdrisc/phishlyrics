(Anastasio/Marshall) 

climb that hill, stay on your feet
scramble for your footing when it gets too steep
you’re on the highway now with higher hopes
while all around are rolling eggs with living yolks

you never get too sad, you never get too blue
it must be all the chemtrails raining down on you
the justice of the peace can’t help you anymore
and they just took the covers off the justice of war

you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on

the storm is passing through, lay down your sticks and stones
the struggle's over now, we’re all just flesh and bones
we were wrong before, it was wrong to trust
the shadows cast were only light and dust

and then one day you find to your intense delight
that three wrong turns can really make a right
so why not be like me?  be proud of all your crimes
‘cause when I screw up once, I do it two more times

you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on

and we’ll be dancing in the fields, running through the moor
tripping on the barbed wire, buried near the shore
blazing like a comet, brighter than the full moon
so you better get ready, ‘cause a change is coming soon

I met a liar called the messiah
I got the frying pan, I wanted fire
I saw a red dress, I met a daughter
I got the quicksand, I prayed for water

you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
