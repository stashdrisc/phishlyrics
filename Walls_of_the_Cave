I'm leaving you a message
I'm leaving you a trace
I'm leaving thoughts for you
I hope that time will not erase
And when the moment comes 
to read the words that I engrave
You'll find them on the walls of the cave

I know you heard the question
but you didn't make a sound
And when it fell you caught my heart
before it hit the ground
But if you ever need the names 
of those you couldn't save
You'll find them on the walls of the cave

Look at me
The time stands still
The mountain here is now a hill
Look away
The time goes past
These rocks will fall away at last

Maybe you will see it
as you're passing by alone
Below the moss forgotten
where some words adorn a stone
It might have been an etching
on a marker of a grave
Or maybe on the walls of the cave

Listen to
The silent trees
But still your words 
float on the breeze
Look away
I see them all
Carved into the cavern wall
