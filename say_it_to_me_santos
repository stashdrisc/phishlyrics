SAY IT TO ME S.A.N.T.O.S. (Santos)

My thoughts are frozen like everyone else
you will always be remembered
even life itself

say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
and try to make it rhyme
say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
normal moving time
say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
its off to work we go

Haho aho aho!

This is what space smells like
you will always remember where you were
This is what space smells like
you will always remember where you were

My thoughts are frozen like everyone else
you will always be remembered
even life itself

say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
and try to make it rhyme
say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
In normal moving time
say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S
itâ€™s off to work we go

Haho aho aho!
