WE ARE COME TO OUTLIVE OUR BRAINS
Everything’s overlapping
To future to the passing
We are only passing through
We’re vapor, light, and liquid blue
Take a look around
It’s exactly how it’s supposed to be
Take a look around
The shapes are hanging over me
Take a look around
The shapes are hanging over you
Take a look around
Stop trying to rush nature
Slow it down
We will come to outlive our brains (I see you in the distance as I frown)
We will come to outlive our brains (I see you in the distance as I frown)
We will come to outlive our brains (I see you in the distance as I frown)
We will come to outlive our brains (I see you in the distance as I…)

We will come to outlive our brains
We will come to outlive our brains
We will come to outlive our brains
We will come to outlive our brains
