Running Out Of Time
(Anastasio/Marshall)

A flash of light
another moment stolen from my soul
A thunderclap
again I must surrender all control

Sudden noises startle me 
and strange things in my mind
Haunt me and I'm running scared
Running out of time
Running out of time

There are days when sunlight
seems to lift me from my bed
And other times I face the light
with eyelids full of lead

Light and dark pass quickly by
with no dividing line
I follow but I'm running scared
Running out of time (running out of time)
Running out of time (running out of time)
Running out of time

[Round Room version]

Never been chosen (running out of time)
Selected, preferred (running out of time)
Singled out of favor (running out of time)
As far as I've heard (running out of time)

Its a red mark on my shoulder, and so
Maybe god touched me
and I didn't know (running out of time)
