Saw it Again
(Anastasio, Marshall)

Well, I saw it again
(I saw it again)
A form in my window
(in my window)
It wants to come in
(it wants to come in)
Well, I seen it before
(I seen it before)

When I wake up in the night
(I'm pulled from my dreams)
Well, when something's not right
I try not to look
(but the curtains pull open its breathing I hear)
For there is the shape
That I fear
And I'm fully woken
I saw it again

I saw it again
I saw it again
I saw it again
I saw it again
