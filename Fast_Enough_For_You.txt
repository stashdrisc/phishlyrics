Fast Enough For You

If time were only part of the equation
Then you could draw the boundaries of our cage
You wouldn't pile another stone upon me
And I'd be happy just to watch you age

But everything is in its own dominion
And waiting in the shallows as I do
Appeases me as water slowly trickles out
Which isn't nearly fast enough for you

It isn't nearly fast enough for you
It isn't nearly fast enough for you
Its what I was afraid of
I stumble into view
But it isn't nearly fast enough for you
It isn't nearly fast enough for you
