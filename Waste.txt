don't want to be an actor, pretending on the stage
don't want to be a writer with my thought out on the page
don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look
don't want to be anything where my life's an open book

don't want to be a farmer, working in the sun
don't want to be an outlaw, always on the run
don't want to be a climber, reaching for the top
don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop

a dream it's true
but I'd see it through
if I could be
wasting my time with you

so if I'm inside your head
don't believe what you might have read
you'll see what I might have said
to hear it
come waste your time with me
