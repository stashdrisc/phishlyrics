Anastasio/Marshall

I found a ring deep inside a box on a dead-end street
and you were there watching me 
but I didn’t know I couldn’t see 
I was lost, asleep inside a fantasy

I love your hair in the mornings, you know
you love to run wild, and let the mane flow
but you run away, but we meet again soon
south of the border and over the moon

and when you’re gone it never feels right
gets so cold in the dark of the night
and I only like the shade when you’re blocking the light
I only like the shade when you’re blocking the light

I put the ring, back where it belongs
it feels right, and you were waiting up all night
I didn’t know, if I went away
and got lost, that you’d still be there anyway

I figured out what you whispered last night
somewhere the clouds touch the mountains just right
somewhere we’re dancing and you’re singing the tune
south of the border and over the moon

and when you’re gone it never feels right
it gets so cold in the dark of the night
and I only like the shade when you’re blocking the light
I only like the shade when you’re blocking the light
