Sleep Again
(Anastasio/O'Brien)

Slow slow, my brother
You will sleep again
Long long, when it passes
You will breathe again
Snow falls...
and it passes

Time time, in good time
You will live again
Hold on, when it passes
You will be again

Long long, on and on
Carefree and downstream
You will live again
You will live again
You will live again

All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...
You will live again
You will live again

Slow slow, my brother
You will sleep again
Long long, when it passes
You will breathe again
Snow falls...
and it passes

You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again

All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...
All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...

You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again
