COOL AMBER AND MERCURY
Cool Amber and Mercury
Pay me no attention
When the night turns into day
Sometimes when I’m moving
I still miss this place

what a fool I was
what a fool I am
what a fool I’ll be

Cool Amber and Mercury, Cool Amber and Mercury, Cool Amber and Mercury

Pay me no attention
When the night turns into day
Sometimes when I’m standing still
Thing don’t feel alright

Cool Amber and Mercury, Cool Amber and Mercury, Cool Amber and Mercury

You say the most hurtful things
