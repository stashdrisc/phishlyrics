Blind me with ambition 
like a razor to the throat
Cast aside your foolish pride 
I'll cast the final vote
The feelings you've been waiting for 
are clawing through your skin
And if you look above 
you'll see the vultures moving in

Timing is everything 
that much I know
Sometimes I'm faster 
and sometimes I'm slow
Some days I'm patient 
but sometimes I'm told
To go to the end of the line
But when I can't be
what's expected of me
I look at the clock 
and say "this can't be"
Watching it pass 
without reason or rhyme
I find myself drifting in time

I see the vultures moving in
I find myself drifting in time

Paulatek reminds me of The Bible
Andromeda was used, I think, before
My guess is that I'll never name this ghost well
But I think I hear him knocking at my door
(repeat)

Blind me with ambition
like a razor to the throat
Cast aside your foolish pride 
I'll cast the final vote
The feelings you've been waiting for 
are clawing through your skin
But if you look above 
you'll see the vultures moving in
