Ocelot
(Anastasio, Marshall)

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
Morning is over
and noon slouches on 

Your stripes could all fade 
in the poisonous day 
When you see the sunlight
move out of the way 

You prance with the beasts 
who parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest by light 
Don’t be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the herd
and float with the flock 

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where are you now? 
You never listen to me anyhow 
You wandered and ambled
you walked, now you run 
Knowing you’ll bake 
like a snake in the sun 
You prance with the beasts 
you parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest twilight 

Don’t be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the heard
and float with the flock 

You prance with the beasts 
you parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest twilight 

Don’t be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the heard
and float with the flock 

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Won’t you come out to play?) 
Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Won’t you come out to play?) 
Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Won’t you come out to play?)
