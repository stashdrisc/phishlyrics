Train Song

All the way home we felt we had a chance
To review the coulds before we were born
And to invite a new game of cant’s
Absorbed in the clouds, a voice from afar said,
“With the right device you can make a pattern grow
or you can tune up your car”

So we stayed on the train admiring the time
As the lights of the city drew near
We drank a little wine
They were blurry and green, outer space in between,
With a depth and a form unclear
Then we saw it up ahead

A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge
From the banks of a river 
to the bed of a valley upstream
to the place where you live

The glass from the lantern cast back the sight
of a drive-in movie we drove by below
We saw where we’d been in the pictures within,
Projecting all the places we would go

So we followed the scene and flowed up your steps
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance
The train whistle melody wove through the trees
and in through the door to signal the turns of a dance
