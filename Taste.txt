Taste
(Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Marshall, McConnell)

I'm up and I can take what you give
And I'm here but I don't want you to live with me
'Cause all I want is a taste for free

I'm down and I will drag you along and around
Until you burst into song and unwind
And leave your new life behind for a while

Cause I can see through the lines
Cause I can see through the lines

I'm down and I will drag you along and around
Until you burst into song and unwind
And leave your new life behind for a while

I'm out and I will stay here alone and without
Someone controlled by the phone and TV
'Cause what it's doing to me is fine

Cause I can see through the lines
Cause I can see through the lines

Oooh oooh
Step into space
Oooh oooh
Alter my place
Oooh oooh
That someone else made
Why I have stayed
Into things I could be
Or if I could see
Into fog that surrounds
And pins me to the ground

I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
