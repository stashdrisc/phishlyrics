Architect
(Anastasio, Pollak)

All these worlds
Rolled into one
Together we revolve around the sun
And if you get the chance
Watch the young children dance
In a little while, you will see them smile.

Truth may dazzle
Gradually
It all comes out in the wash eventually
Try to catch a glean
If you know what I mean.
You may even see the cogs in the machine

Reconvene, reconnect
Raise a glass to the Architect
‘Cause it turned out better
So much better
Than we ever did expect

Find your treasures
Where you will
Don’t you stop until you’ve had your fill
Wherever you may go
Look around, take it slow
There might be more to this than we all know

And if we have the chance to see the rough draft
I bet the early plans would make us laugh
And it never seems to help when we try to intervene
Some things are better left unseen

Reconvene, reconnect
Raise a glass to the Architect
‘Cause it turned out better
So much better
Than we ever did expect
