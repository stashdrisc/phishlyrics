Joy

Joy is over there in her incredible clothes
She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes
I was doing the best that I can I suppose
But that little girl dancer eventually grows 
She grows

You can’t imagine all the times that I tried 
To uncover the source of the tears that you cried
Let’s throw it away and just go for a ride
And you’d say ok but you’d keep it inside
And I tried

We want you to be happy
Don’t live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
Cause this is your song too

I never thought I could have it so good
You were the song that my soul understood 
But time is a river that flows through the woods
And it led us to place we both understood
Would be gone
Before too long

When we were young we thought life was a game
But then somebody leaves you and you’re never the same
All of the places and people belong 
To the puzzle but one of the pieces is gone
And it’s you
Joy, it’s you

We want you to be happy
Don’t live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
Cause this is your song too

In time we’ll weather this storm
Inside together you’ll see the change
When the sun shines through

We want you to be happy
Don’t live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
‘Cause this is your song too
