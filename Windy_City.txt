In the basement once again
its to the depths I only find below
Looking up the basement window
catching all the shadows and the snow
hoping that this windy city 
keeps debris from blanketing my show

The stations there upon the chair
I watch his boxes turn from grey to green
the sound of sirens disappears 
as I turn down the sound on my TV
if you got a question 
please direct it to the number on your screen

Hell comes to receive me now
signals retrieve me now
onto the screen right now
help me to see

In the car the engine starts
to charge imparts a feeling onto me
in my mind I think its time 
to let this thing unfold or let it be
hoping that this memory 
is more about the future I might see

Hell comes to receive me now
signals retrieve me now
onto the screen right now
help me to see
