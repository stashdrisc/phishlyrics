Let Me Lie
(Anastasio)

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Leave me way up here
up on the mountain
let me lie uncovered
on the floor

Make me wonder when
you go away again
if you're ever 
coming back here anymore

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly

I don't care what you did
but I can tell its hanging over you
the effects of sun and sand
are hard to understand

So leave me way up here
up on the mountain
let me lie, oohâ€¦

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna use my brakes
when I go downhill
Gonna climb back on 
when I take a spill

Gonna peel my shirt off
gonna feel it burn
gonna keep my eyes closed
gonna miss my turn

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
gonna ride it slowly

Let me lie
Let me lie
Let me lie
Let me lie

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
(Let me lie)
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like
(Let me lie)

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
(Let me lie)
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like
(Let me lie)

Gonna use my breaks
when I go downhill
Gonna climb back on 
when I take a spill

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna peel my shirt off
gonna feel it burn
gonna keep my eyes closed
gonna miss my turn

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like
