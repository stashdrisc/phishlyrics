Well it was many years ago now
But I really can't be sure
That's when it all began then
I heard that knock upon my door

And the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Came down on me

Well, the telephone was ringing
That's when I handed it to Liz
She said, "This isn't who it would be,
If it wasn't who it is"

It's the wolfman's brother,
The wolfman's brother
Came down on me

So I might be on a side street
Or a stairway to the stars
I hear the high pitched cavitation
Of propellers from afar

It's the wolfman's brother...
Come down on me

So with meaningless excitement
And smooth atonal sound
It's like a cross between a hurricane
And a ship that's run aground

It's the wolfman's brother
Coming down on
coming down on me
