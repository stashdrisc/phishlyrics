Frankie Says

Time is me and I should know
I knew this several months ago
I knew more than I do now
For I've been turned around somehow

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare
Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I change the landscape as I pass
Meandering from sand to glass
I suction there for one whole day
Until the feeling goes away

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I don't need these orbits in my life
Revolve and cycle through
Don't keep coming back for more

I don't need this circular design
Wheel and spin away from me
You've been by here before

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare
Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I've lost my mind
I've lost my way
I'm bound to lose
You wonder where I am
