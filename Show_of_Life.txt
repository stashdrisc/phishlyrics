Show of Life
(Anastasio, Pollak)

It’s no easy road
this struggle and strife
We find ourselves in the show of life
What’s on the schedule
What’s on your plan
Do you ever ignore
What you don’t understand

Don’t ask me ’cause I don’t know
I just fasten my seat belt wherever I go

It’s been perfectly planned
it’s completely insane
it’s a revolving cast
but it’s the same old game

Waves of people
They come and they go
Shine for a while
It’s a marvelous show

it’s a limited time that we exist
We slowly make our way into the mist

My thoughts are racing
I see faces of the friends that I recall
I’d like to take this time to thank you all

Just as the blind imagine
what it is to have sight
We slowly take a stroll into the night

It’s no easy road
This struggle and strife
We find ourselves in the show of life

In the show of life
In the show of life
(Find myself right here)

In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)
In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)
In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)
