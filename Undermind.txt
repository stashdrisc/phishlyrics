Undermind
(Anastasio, Marshall, Herman)

Undecided, undefined 
Undisturbed yet undermined
Relocated not retired
Reprimanded and rewired
Mystified and misshapen
Misinformed but not mistaken
Reinvented, redefined
Rearranged but not refined
Unrelenting, understroked
Undeterred yet unprovoked
Reinvented, redefined
Rearranged but not refined 
Mystified and misshapen
Misinformed but not mistaken
Undecided, undefined
