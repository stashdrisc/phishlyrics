Possum
(Holdsworth)

I come from atop the mountain baby
Where the people come to pray
I come from atop the mountain baby
Where the people come to pray
There ain't no truth in action
'Less you believe it anyway


I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum
I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum
The road was his end
His end was the road
So they say


Whoa possum...
possum, possum...
POSSUM
Whoa possum...
possum, possum... 
POSSUM
Whoa possum, possum
Your end is the road


I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum
I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum

So they say


Whoa possum... 
possum, possum...
POSSUM
Whoa possum... 
possum, possum... 
POSSUM
Whoa possum,
Your end is the road
Whoa possum, possum
Your end is the road
