Bittersweet Motel

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel

Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh
You're putting me through hell
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel

Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh
You're putting me through hell
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel
