PLAY BY PLAY
Down below my feet
Last forever
Down below my feet
As for ever

Down below my feet
Last forever
Dark and scary
I double down

I was there I ran away
I was in the news
When I heard the play by play
I wanted to be used
When I heard the play by play
I wanted to be used

Perception is spoon fed
I open up my mouth
Perception is spoon fed
I open up my mouth

Perception is spoon fed
I open up my mouth
Perception is spoon fed
I open up my mouth

I hope someone notices

I hope someone notices
I hope someone notices
Iâ€¦..


I hope someone notices (sweet longing freezes time)

Sweet longing freezes time


I hope someone notices (sweet longing freezes time)
I hope someone notices (sweet longing freezes time)
I hope someone notices (sweet longing freezes time)
I hope someone notices (sweet longing freezes time)
