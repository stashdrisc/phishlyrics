Dog Log (aka Dog Gone Dog)
(Anastasio)

Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
Walkin cross a lawn
Walkin through the dawn dawn dawn

Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
(I've been) walkin cross the lawn
(I've been) wonderin where my dog done gone

Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log
Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log
Stepped upon a log, (while I was) walkin through the fog fog fog

Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log
It was a dog log here
I knew that she was near, it was still steamin'

Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
I've been walkin cross the lawn.

Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
(I've been) walkin cross the lawn
(I've been) wanderin through the dawn dawn dawn

Walkin cross a lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn, lawn
(I've been) walkin cross a lawn
(I've been) wonderin where my dog done gone

Where's my dog gone?
Where's my dog gone?
Where's my dog gone?

Gone Gone
