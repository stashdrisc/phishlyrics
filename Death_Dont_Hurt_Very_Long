DEATH DON’T HURT VERY LONG
Death Don’t hurt very long
Death Don’t hurt very long
Death Don’t hurt very long
Death Don’t hurt very long
Oh Yeah
Frozen in place, cast into space

Transported too fast, you know it don’t last

Up on the ground, shakin’ my sound

Descended from apes, you’re just changin’ shapes

Death Don’t hurt very long, Death Don’t hurt very long, Death Don’t hurt very long
Death. Don’t. hurt. very. long.

Death Don’t hurt very long
Its only your perception, singin’ this song

Death Don’t hurt very long
Its only your perception, singin’ this song
