Heavy Things
(Anastasio, Marshall, Herman)

Things have fallen down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

Vanessa calls me on the phone
Reminding me I'm not alone
I fuss and quake and cavitate
I try to speak and turn to stone

Tilly reaches through my vest
To do the thing that she does best
She probes and tears my ventricles
And steals my one remaining breath

Things have fallen down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

Stumbling as I fall from Grace
She needs my vision to replace
Her ailing sight throughout the night
Leaving two holes in my face

Mary was a friend I'd say
Until one summer day
She borrowed everything I own
And simply ran away

Things have fallen down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried
To step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be
