Mike's Song
(Gordon)

Trapped in time and I don't know what to do
These friends of mine, I can see right through.
You don't gotta tell me that I don't gotta move
'Cause I'm just sittin' back here sharing in the groove.
Me no are no nice guy

I walk through the hallways inside my mind
I chase the backbeat falling behind
Big dude in the doorway blocking my way
He reached and grabbed me and this is what he said:
Me no are no nice guy
