Scents and Subtle Sounds
(Anastasio, Marshall, Herman)

If you would stop and notice that we number every day
But allow the many moments left uncounted slip away

You donâ€™t have to count them, just enjoy them one by one
Then things would take a different hue and sparkle in the sun
The winds would lift you up into the sky

The winds would lift you up into the sky above
Where you would see a trail of treasured memories you love 
A rainbow record of the thoughts and moments you've enjoyed
Arcs behind the earth as spectral colors in the void

In the void
Scents and subtle sounds
