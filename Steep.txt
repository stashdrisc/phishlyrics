Steep
(Anastasio/Marshall/Gordon/McConnell/Fishman)

Much ado is all I see
in fact it is surrounding me
the seething crowd intrudes all day
'til finally I'm swept away

although I thought my roots were deep
I sank them into hillsides steep
and riverbanks that soon erode
near canyons that have overflowed
