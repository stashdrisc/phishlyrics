Spock's Brain
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell)

You can't lie
You can't lie to yourself, very long
You can't lie
You can't lie to yourself, very long

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time

You can't hide
You can't hide from yourself, not at all
You can't hide
You can't hide from yourself, not at all

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time

I don't know how I'll die, but it won't be money
The plane
The plane
Plane on time

I was standing on the runway
I was running to the standby
I'll never understand why
Stood by the stand guy
A-waitin' for the standby

I was standing on the runway
(He was asking for it anyway)
Running to the standby
I'll never understand why
Stood by the stand by
A-waitin' for the stand guy

You can't hide
You can't lie
You can't lie
You can't hide

So go ahead and try to be
Gimme a ticket defy to be 
Nobody said to cover me with tartar
Go outside and visit the ground
Imagine demanded to smash in the mouth
About to smash in the mouth

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
