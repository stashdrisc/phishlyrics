The Sloth
(Anastasio/Marshall)

They call me the sloth
(Way down in the ghetto)
Italian Spaghetti
(Singing falsetto)
Sleeping all day
(Rip Van Winklin')
Spend my nights in bars
(Glasses tinklin')

I'm so bad
(He's so nasty
Ain't got no friends
(Real out-casty)
Stay out of my way
(Or you'll end up a cripple)
I'll take this piece of paper
(And slice your nipple)

They call me the sloth
(Way down in the ghetto)
Italian Spaghetti
(Singing falsetto)
Sleeping all day
(Rip Van Winklin')
Spend my nights in bars
(Glasses tinklin')
