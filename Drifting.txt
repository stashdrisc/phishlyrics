Drifting

I've been drifting, 
For years at sea. 
But now, you've come along, 
to rescue me. 

And the fog is lifted, 
We got the moon and the stars above. 

Since you came along, (love, love, love) 
I'm back where I belong. 
(love, love, love) 
Since you rescued me, 
(love, love, love) 
The whole world is there to see. 

And the storm has lifted. 
We've got the moon and stars above.. 

In Mornin' 
It's plain to see. 
Smell coffee in the air. 
You're here with me. 

I'm walkin' down the street.(love, love, love) 
The sun beams down. (love, love, love) 
The grass is cool beneath my feet. 
My head is spinnin' round and round' 

And the storm has lifted. 
We've got the moon and stars above.
