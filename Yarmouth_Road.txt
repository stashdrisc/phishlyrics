I dig a deep hole, bees buzzing all around
But I know you’ll be happy
That I’m pouring concrete in the ground

Hoist up posts and beams erratically
Garden plot’s beautiful, Painter gets at it
But I guess I should have checked with you somehow

Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb
All I ever wanted you to do was to come on home
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb

I filled up the shelves with funny books to laugh to
Lazy susan has some of the mocha rings that you love
Registered our names so they’ll know where to bring us our mail

Couldn’t find flat wax for all the mahogany
Didn’t we see some walking through a trade show
Does any of this even start to ring a bell

Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb
All I ever wanted you to do was to come on home
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb, when we need to roam

Blind faith stings hastily
My faith brings me, right to the flower shop
I’d like that bouquet please, wrap some of those extra green things around the stems
A little card to write on if you have them

Candles are lit all the red napkins folded
Pecan pie wafting fumes from the oven
Turned off all the ringers on the phones

Look out the window see headlights passing by
Maybe I don’t see you and I don’t really know why
Don’t make me feel like a guest in our own home
