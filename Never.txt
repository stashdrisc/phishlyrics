Never
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Never is that point in time
That doesn't have dimension
Always is the measure of
How my time's been around

In those are points I've made
But that's beyond my grasp
I'm rooted in the now
And that's what keeps me on the ground and memory

Never to forget that I forgot you for awhile
