Julius
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Danger
I've been told to expect it 
I begin my descent 
Down the cold granite steps 

And who could have turned among those I confide in? 
I think that I know what I haven't known yet 
'Cause a week is a month 
and an hour a day 
When your reaching just pushes it further away 
With your past and your future precisely divided 
Am I at that moment? I haven't decided 

And stretching out into the sea... Aquitana 
Is that what the prophet told me he saw? 
You gave it to me but I really don't want it 
I came out on top by the luck of the draw 
'Cause a week is a month and an hour a day 
When your reaching just pushes it further away 
And what's the return on the faith I've provided?
I think that I know now but I haven't decided

Don't take another, don't take another, don't take another step
Don't blame it on yourself
Then you'll lay it on ya brotha when your sleeping
You'll wake up in the morning and he'll be gone

Before you take another step
Don't blame it on yourself
'Cause if you lay it on a brother when he's sleeping
You'll wake up in the morning and he'll be gone
