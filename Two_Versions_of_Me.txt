Two Versions of Me

Ten mountains stand tall
Nine seasons since fall
Eight eons of sand
Seven oceans began
Now there is none
No more light from the sun
Now waters run free
No more fish in the sea

One more name on the slate 
One less minute to wait
Too busy to see two versions of me
One more bottle is dry 
One less reason to try

Six feet underneath
Five fingers donâ€™t reach
Four seconds it seems for all of our dreams
Three oceans away
Two children at play
Too busy to see two versions of me
