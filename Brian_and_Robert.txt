Brian And Robert
(Anastasio, Marshall)

If you're just staring at your walls
Observing echoing footfalls
From tenants wandering distant halls
Than this one is for you

If children playing all around
To you is noise not pleasant sound
And you'd be lost on the playground
Then this one is for you

All alone the life you lead
A silent diner where you feed
You bow your head pretend to read
this one if for you

Slip past strangers in the street
There's no one that you care to meet
Longing for your TV seat
this one is for you
