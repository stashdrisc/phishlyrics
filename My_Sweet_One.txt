My Sweet One
(Fishman)

My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
You're my only true sweet one
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
From far away, I'll say your name

Oh with you, I'd travel thick
And with you, I'd also travel thin
And all the spaces in between
I'd travel with you, you're my sweet one

But for now I must sit here and ponder the yonder
Herbivores ate well cause their food didn't never run
Oh, if You're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating You
You know You can count on me to take good care of You

I love you honey oh yes I do
You know that's true of course
and if your dog or cat ever dies,
I'll buy you a ewe

My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
You're my only true sweet
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
Far away
I'll say your name
