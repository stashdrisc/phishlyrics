Prince Caspian
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian
with nothing to return to but the demons in their caves

Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian
And the children in the fields are sowing seed and chaffing wheat
oh to be Prince Caspian with stumps instead of feet

Oh, to be Prince Caspian
