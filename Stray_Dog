STRAY DOG
I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town, yeah
Pay me no attention as I trundle around
Punching me down, I’m going to chase you down

I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town, yeah
Hollowin’ wind and the driving rain
Once you look closer, you’ll like what you’ve found

I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town
Pay me no attention as I wander around
Hunting you down, I’m going to chase you down

I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town, yeah
Hollowin’ wind and the driving rain
Once you look closer, you’ll like what you’ve found

It’s over here, it’s over there
It’s over here, it’s over there
It’s over here, over there
Over here, over there
Over here, there, here, there, here, there…

I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town, now
Pay me no attention as I wander around
Hunting you down, going to chase you down

I’m like a stray dog
Loping into town
Hollowin’ wind and the driving rain
Once you look closer, you’ll like what you’ve found
