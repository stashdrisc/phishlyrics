Things People Do
(McConnell)

People always surprising
The things that they do
You think you got em' figured out
And they'll show you what you knew
At first they may seem rational
But wait a month or two
'Cause there's just no explaining
The things people do

I had to get away
I was losing my interest
Instead of expanding my world
I was just scanning pinterest
So I left all these people
I though that I knew
'Cause there's just no explaining
The things people do

I left for the road
'Cause I needed the mileage
Brought what I owned
'Cause I thought it was stylish
Well I don't miss the folks
That I just left behind me
'Cause there's places I'm going
Kinda doubt they will find me

I never really felt
That my life was in danger
But a shot to the gut
By the hands of a stranger
Started me thinking
What I already knew
That there's just know explaining
The things people do

Well I found a new place quickly
I caught me a fast one
The people 'round here
Are the same as the last one
So I guess I'll keep moving
And find a new crew
'Cause there's just no explaining
The things people do
