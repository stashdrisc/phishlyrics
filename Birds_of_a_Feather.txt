Birds of a Feather 
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell/Marshall)

It's easy sometimes when you just coast along
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
or perhaps you will laugh and you will make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for a while

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
of ritual drumming although at first glance
you thought you could run but you won't take a chance

it's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
they hang on emotions they bottle inside
they peck at the ground 
and they strut out of stride
