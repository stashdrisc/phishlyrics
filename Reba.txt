Reba
(Anastasio)

Reba sink a boulder in the water
Reba tie a cable to a tree
Reba stuck in a game of lipstick perfume flypaper
Reba press a razor to a slide cross a needle with a prune

Knee deep in the motel tub
Reba dangle ladle form her lip
dip
sip
Reba babble to the nag with the lipstick perfume
mutter to a farmer in a truck

Take a peek at the cheetah, Reba
cheetah on the prowl in a cage
sink a boulder in the water
tie a cable to a tree

Mutter "nature" to the nag
with the lipstick perfume
Reba flush a fleshfarm leftover
thunder in a circle
down the pipes

Bag it
Tag it
Sell it to the butcher in the store

Reba put a stopper in the bottom of the tub
picked up a jar unscrewed the top
and watched it drop into the water

A little scoop of plaster mix
some coffee grounds and mud
and then she stirred it with the ladle
that her Grandmother had bought her
threw in a pot of melted wax
a forefoot and a hoof
apple core, worms galore
and a can of some corrosive

coconuts and chloroform
some wicker and some cork
Toxic waste, some purple paste
she hoped was not explosive

Reba dip a ladle for a taste of her creation
and she knew that what she make
would be the finest in the nation
