Tela
(Anastasio)

The sky is burning in this lonely land
And i kneel by the river and i feel the sand and the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain
And she comes to me in this lonely land
And looks down from the multi-beast on which she rides like the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain

[The following verse appears in early versions of the song]

Tela was born in a vulgar crooked hut
In the shadow of Wilson's castle
Venomous scorn from a life of bitter toil
In the shadow of Wilson's castle
Glorious steam fueled by her hatred it grew
Swelling to the point where it would
Burst at the seems there was nothing she could do

Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
A lullaby the breezes whisper

And I look into her eyes and my frozen heart begins to thaw
And burn, 'til layer after layer melts away into a pool
A sky blue mirror of her eyes
And my soul is made of marble but in her gaze I crumble into dust
And drift away on the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain

[The following verse appears in early versions of the song]

Tela grew strong from her struggle to endure
In the shadow of wilson's castle
Time touched her wounds and shelter proved the cure
In the shadow of wilson's castle
Each passing day seemed to feed the brazen serpent locked inside
And liberate the spirit she'd concealed for so long
There was no place left to hide

Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
A lullaby the breezes whisper
