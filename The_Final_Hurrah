THE FINAL HURRAH
Sitting on the jungle gym
The shapes become unhinged
Try to cover up,
Hush money in the cup,
That much i know.

I am in a square,
dangling in mid-air,
so i split my eyes
there may only be a few
That much i know

Taste the humidity
You can recycle
I see you in the distance
you can recycle
the final hurrah

Taste the humidity
You can recycle
I see you in the distance
you can recycle
the final hurrah
the final hurrah
the final hurrah
the faceplant
into rock
