Strange Design
(Anastasio/Marshall)

I'm needing less restraint before 
I'm needing to hit the lights and close the door 
I'm fine, I'm fine cause I'm... 

(Chorus)
Dripping in this strange design 
None is yours and far less mine 
Hold the wheel, read the sign 
Keep the tires off the line 
Just relax, you're doing fine 
Swimming in this real thing I call life 
Can I bring a few companions on this ride? 

I'm feeling, my heart's not beating anymore 
I'm feeling. it's alright, this happened once before 
I'm fine, I'm fine cause I'm...
