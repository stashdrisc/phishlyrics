Set Your Soul Free

I’m trying to share, what it’s all about
Let the music do the talking, it will help you out
Stay up for days, don’t get down
Roll with the funk now, turn it around

Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free
We’re all here together, in this spirit family
Everybody's dancing, everyone can see
Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free, 
Set your soul free

On the go, I'm singing this song
They’re digging my grave, and it won’t be long
So take a little trip, feel a little rain 
Aim a little higher, and try to ignore the pain

Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free
We’re all here together, in this spirit family
Everybody's dancing, everyone can see
Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free

Set your, set your, set your, set your, soul free (4X)

Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free
We’re all here together, in this spirit family
Everybody's dancing, everyone can see
Burn it down burn it down, set your soul free

Set your soul free (Repeat)
