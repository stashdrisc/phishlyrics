Backwards Down the Number Line 
(Anastasio, Marshall)

Happy happy oh my friend
Blow out candles once again
Leave the presents all inside
Take my hand
And let’s take a ride
Backwards down the number line
You were eight and I was nine
Do you know what happened then?

Do you know why we’re still friends?
Laughing all these many years
We pushed through hardships tasted tears
Made a promise one to keep
I can still recite it in my sleep
Every time a birthday comes
Call your friend and sing a song
Or whisper it into his ear
Or write it down
Just don’t miss a year

You decide what it contains
How long it goes but this remains
The only rule is it begins
Happy happy oh my friend

You decide what it contains
How long it goes but this remains
The only rule is it begins
Happy happy oh my friend

All my friends
Come backwards down the number line

And when I see you coming down the line
With eyes wide open
Somewhere in between the past and future
Where you drift in time
And you can see a different point of view
