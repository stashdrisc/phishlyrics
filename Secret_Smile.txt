Secret Smile
(Anastasio/Marshall)

Sometimes when the evening's young
The wind dies down, the setting sun 
Crochets the clouds with yarn so fine
And fills the oceans with red wine

The trees, the sky, the forest fair
Bring a flavor to the air
I raise my glass and in a while 
You answer with a secret smile

Hold on, hold on to me 

An airborne leaf that landed near 
Has carried Dionysus here
Heâ€™ll slip away but only when 
He sees our glasses filled again
