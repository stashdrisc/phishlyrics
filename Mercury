(Anastasio/Marshall) 

The days that are met with onlyness
Aid and abet this loneliness
The days that are met with onlyness
Aid and abet this loneliness

Tonight's the night
the wheels are turning
the signal flows
I try to keep the home fires burning
That was my stop
but the subway kept going
nothing to lose
When Mercury's
Showing

(The days that are met with onlyness, aid abet this loneliness)

The moments are mine
If I can just seize the day
But then I forget
what it is I meant to say
I try to hold on
but never too tight
and the hours go by
till Mercury comes out at night

Venus in steel the unbreakable net
Venus in steel the unbreakable net
Staring up at the great machine
that never began and will never end
the silver starlit tapestry
With countless eyes staring back at me
the trail of lilies and violets ends
Trapped in Steel the Unbreakable Net

---

And the rivers run deep
like a quick silver stream
With wings on your feet
your day is longer than your year
Looking the night sky
for a moment, I can see
the rivers run deep
your day is longer than your year
The order in the Chaos
Waits to be perceived
With wings on your feet
your day is longer than your year
The lies they feed to me are as edible as mercury
But the rivers run deep
Your day is longer than your year

(The days that are met with loneliness aid and abet this onlyness)

---

and the Water-star is singing
its silver melody
the rivers run deep
your day is longer than your year
your day is longer than your year

The tomb of the red Queen
is painted in Vermilion painted in Vermilion painted in Vermilion

but the net's unbreakable
so don't worry about falling
the voice that you ignore
might be your future calling
alone we're tossed about
like a bottle in the sea
but together we ascend
and only then escape this gravity
