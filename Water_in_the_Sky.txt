Listen as she speaks to you
hear the voices flutter through
the barriers arranged by you

Close the shutters draw the shades
Filter out the everglades
Glistening with evening dew

Thunder calls through waterfalls
Rising tide and ocean walls
I can hear you when you sigh

Listen as she speaks to you
Hear the voices flutter through
watch them and let them lie

I can hear you when you sigh
Through the water in the sky
