We're bobbing on the surface
and the shadow glides below
They say she feels my heartbeat
Oh... But how I'll never know

That it's the ocean flowing in our veins
Oh... That it's the salt that's in our tears
Oh... 'Cause we could have come so very far
Oh... In at least as many years!

Take the highway through the Great Divide

I'm building you a pyramid
With limestone blocks so large
I drag them from the mountain top
You'll need a two car garage

And it's the ocean flowing in our veins
Oh... That it's the salt that's in our tears
Oh... Cause we could have come so very far
Oh... In at least as many years

Take the highway through the Great Divide

Cause it's the ocean flowing in our veins
Oh... That it's the salt that's in our tears
Oh... Cause we could have come so very far
Oh... In at least as many years

Take the highway through the Great Divide
