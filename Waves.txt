How is it I never see
The waves that bring her words to me
For though unseen they drift around
They catch my breath and knock me down

I feel them quickly swirling by
As they withdraw with my reply
And slip into the dark of night
As I attempt to stay upright

Instead I'm stranded on my knees
As words depart upon the breeze
That quickly drifts away from here
And possibly won't reach her ear

If we could see these many waves
That flow through clouds and sunken caves
She'd sense at least the words that sought her
On the wind and underwater
