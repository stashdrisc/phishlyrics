(Gordon/Murawski)

I saw you in the eyes of the teller, gave my money with a smile 
I saw you on TV a CEO of a company 
I saw you driving by with a scream in your eye 
You seemed not to like the way I swerved between the lines

How many people are you? How many people are you?
How many people like you get caught in the buffer?

I heard you hate the Buddha but you preach all the teachings of Zen 
I heard you check my zodiac a lot but you can't recall my name 
I heard you're so nice like a jackal when you're not try'na hide 
I don't mind, I guess to me it's all the same

How many people are you? How many people are you?
How many people like you get caught in the buffer?

I guess we all know people come and then people will go 
I'm reminded of your fire when the chief of staff comments on the war 
The killer in the thriller that crumbles when the whip-poor-will sings 
And eyelash black haired diner girl sweeping is you even more

How many people are you? How many people are you?
How many people like you get caught in the buffer?

Now you are, now you're not caught in the buffer
