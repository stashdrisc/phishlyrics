Turtle in the Clouds

Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo
Shadows 
Shadows follow toward me as I wander 
Along the shoreline past the people 
And I turn and walk away

House party 
Friends are dancing on the hill side 
For the first time in a long time 
I want to live another day

Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo
I see the turtle in the clouds 
Did I just say that right out loud 
Now I've got something in my shoe 
The green and yellow concrete park 
The hot dog vendor in the dark 
I rode my bike out in the rain
Imaginary rule book 
I keep within my head 
Don't know why I follow 
All the things it said
So pay me no attention 
As I blend in with the mob 
Some people call me clueless 
My last name is Wallob

Clueless Wallob 
Clueless Wallob 
Clueless Wallob (I see the turtle in the clouds) 
Clueless Wallob (Did I just say that right out loud) 
Clueless Wallob (Now I've got something in my shoe) 
Clueless Wallob 
Clueless Wallob (The green and yellow concrete park) 
Clueless Wallob (The hot dog vendor in the dark) 
Clueless Wallob (We rode my bike out in the rain) 
Clueless Wallob
