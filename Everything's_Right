Everything's Right
Time to get out, I paid my dues
I need to shout there's no time to lose
No more to give, the well is dry
The pavement's warm, my brain is fried
It's time to get out, I paid my dues
My shoes have holes, my socks are bare
The mirror's secret is I'm losing my hair
I'm in prison without a crime 
The sentence stretches on undefined 
It's time to get out, I paid my dues
I paid my dues

But, everything's right, so just hold tight 
Everything's right, so just hold tight 
(Repeat x 6)
Just hold tight

I'm going downhill with increasing speed
Compassion gives way, if you listen to greed
Focus on the past and that's what will last
Nothing that is real and nothing you can feel
Focus on tomorrow you'll have to borrow
Images and mind and friends you left behind
Focus on today, you'll find a way
Happiness is how rooting in the now

Because everything's right, so just hold tight 
Everything's right, so just hold tight 
Everything's right, so just hold tight 
Just hold tight 

Look into the eyes of everyone you meet 
Try not to step on your best friend's feet
The line is in the sand, the flag is planted 
The rest of your life don't take it for granted 

Cuz everything's right, so just hold tight 
Everything's right, so just hold tight 
Everything's right, so just hold tight 
Just hold tight 

This world, this world, this crazy world I know
It turns, it turns, and the long night's over and the sun's coming up
(Repeat x 4)

Everything's right, so just hold tight
Everything's right, so just hold tight
Everything's right, so just hold tight
Just hold tight
