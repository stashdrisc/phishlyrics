The Moma Dance
(Anastasio/Fishman/Gordon/McConnell/Marshall)

All throughout I gaze and glimpse you
loving never did convince you
I see you when you're all alone
It's like a person, I've not known

The moment ends though I feel winds
Blowing differently then ever before
And they're pushing me further from shore

The moment ends / though I feel winds 
The moment ends / The moma dance 

a frothy cap the steady slap
of lines against the rail
a biting rain take in the main

Up the rigging
taking sail 
mind the skipper 
we'll not fail
He'll bring out wine 
and we'll be fine 
just heed the order 
watch the sail

The moment ends / though I feel winds 
The moment ends / The moma dance
